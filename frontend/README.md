# Stumblefunk accreditation frontend

My first ever attempt at React. Never touched it before this, so don't judge ;)





### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with Vite.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (base path `/accreditation/`) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
